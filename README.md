Two formalizations of Löb's Theorem.

Axiomatic Formalization
-----------------------
In `axiomatization/`, an axiomatic formalization of Löb's Theorem,
based on [The Cartoon Guide to Löb's
Theorem](http://lesswrong.com/lw/t6/the_cartoon_guide_to_l%C3%B6bs_theorem/)

Internal Formalization
----------------------
In `internal/`, a start on a formalization based on a well-typed
quine, started with the help of Benja Fallenstein at the June 2015
MIRI Workshop on Decision Theory.
